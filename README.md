# Java language support in Atom

[![CI](https://github.com/lunar-editor/language-java/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lunar-editor/language-java/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Add syntax highlighting and snippets to Java/JSP files in Atom. Originally [converted](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate) from the [Java TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/java.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
